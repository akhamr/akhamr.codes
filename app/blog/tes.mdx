Most people often know me as a person who seems "short-fused" and full of hatred. That's half true (can't 100% deny it lol), but saying that I'm such a horrible person to be friends with is a baseless assumption, and here is why...

## Harsh world create harsh man

Lemme introduce myself a bit deeper than usual. As you may know, my name is Khamid Muhammad Arrazaq, born 22 years ago and currently trying to escape poverty by studying at Sebelas Maret University. My dad died a little early when I'm only 12 years old, and because of that, I grew up without such a father figure. It's a truth that hard to accept, and I'll live to it for the rest of my life.

But that's not all... I've had all sort of rough experience such as child abuse, bullying, but even so, I always try to believe everything is in God's way (QS. 36:40) and remember how my pops taught me in the past. He said, as long as you do it, all the sweat that comes out will be paid soon enough, but do not forget to rest whenever you reach your limit.

Although i can endure it all as much as i can, it's still affect my personality & behavior in the long run. I tend to become a sensitive person, whom everything has to be put at the right place because i really hate a mess, I got burnt out easily, I always trying to look tough so that people didn't underestimate me, and somehow i feel left out whenever someone relatively close to me achieves their own goal (or what others call as FOMO)

So yeah, all of that did made me a harsh person **whenever people treat me badly** tho...

## But hey! Everything is not done (yet).
